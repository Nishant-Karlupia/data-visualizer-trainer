# data-visualizer-trainer

This is a Python PyQt5 based app.
In this app I tried to automate much work of the machine learning. Throught the learning journey of Machine Learning I will update the app more so that It becomes an Interactive app for the users

What this app offers (the results are to the latest code work, I am also currently working on this)
  1. View the pandas (.xlsx/.csv) data in form of tabels and columns
  2. See the statistics of the data, like unique values in each coulumn, missing values in each columnm, see the correlation between data fields,...
  3. See the data visually
     
     a. You will have scatter plot to see data between two numeric data fields.
     
     b. See the pie chart (currently working on it so it looks cool)
     
     c. See the bar chart of the whole data frame or see frequnecy of unique values of a particular column in the data frame.

  5. Next function is the most important, here you just upload your data, select the training and target variable select the different imputators/encoders/scaling for each coloumn, then select an ML model and your model will train on a click.You can also predict the model's result on custom input.

# You need not to write any code for any of the functionality.

see the work below
